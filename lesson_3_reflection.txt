When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to 1) collaborate with others 2) share my work to others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Then I can choose which commit to upload or download.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Clone is copy locally or remotely. Fork is copy inside GitHub. Branches are commits having same tags in a row.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    1, can work remotely; 2, can merge it with local commits

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    May have to talk or use "review mode". It would be hard to conmunicate and store the changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
